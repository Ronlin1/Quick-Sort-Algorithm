## Quick-Sort-Algorithm
#### Python Implementation

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, 
serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of a random access file or an array in order.

Quicksort works by selecting an element called a pivot and splitting the array around that pivot in Python.

We split array such that all the elements in, say, the left sub-array are less than the pivot and all the elements 
in the right sub-array are greater than the pivot.

The splitting continues until the array can no longer be broken into pieces. Thatâ€™s it. Quicksort is done.
